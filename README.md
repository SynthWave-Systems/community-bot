# TypeScript Community Bot

_A utility bot built for the [TypeScript Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/typescript)._

# Contributing

See the [documentation](https://cookiecord.js.org/) for the framework we use.

We also have a docker-compose.yml for development, along with a .env.example.

**A quick note about the help channel system:** Please only use it if you have a large server (10k+ members) as it will likely inconvenience your members rather than benefit them. We used a static channel system (#help-1 and #help-2) up until around 9,000 members, when we started to see issues arising (many questions being asked on top of each other without answers).

## Thanks!

-   [ckie](https://github.com/ckiee) for writing the base for the bot.
-   [Python Discord](https://github.com/python-discord) for heavily influencing our help channel system.
